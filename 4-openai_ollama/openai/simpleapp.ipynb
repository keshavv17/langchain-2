If you are on the Enterprise plan and have questions about cost optimization, reach out to your sales rep or support@langchain.dev.\\nYou will learn how to optimize existing spend and prevent future overspend in LangSmith, which includes:\\n\\nReducing existing costs with data retention policies.\\nPreventing future overspend with usage limits.\\n\\nThis tutorial will use an existing LangSmith organization with high usage. You can transfer the concepts from this example to your own organization. The example organization has three workspaces, one for each deployment stage (Dev, Staging, and Prod):\\n\\n\\u200bUnderstand your current usage\\nThe first step of any optimization process is to understand current usage. LangSmith provides two ways to do this: Usage graph and Invoices.\\n\\u200bUsage graph\\nThe usage graph lets you examine how much of each usage-based pricing metric you have consumed. It does not directly show spend (which you will review later in the draft invoice).\\nYou can navigate to the usage graph under Settings -> Usage and Billing -> Usage Graph.\\n\\nThis graph shows that there are two usage metrics that LangSmith charges for:\\n\\nLangSmith Traces (Base Charge): tracks all traces that you send to LangSmith.\\nLangSmith Traces (Extended Data Retention Upgrades): tracks all traces that also have our Extended 400 Day Data Retention.\\n\\nFor more details, refer to the data retention conceptual docs. Notice that these graphs look identical, which you will review later in the tutorial.\\nLangSmith Traces usage is measured per workspace, because workspaces often represent development environments (as in the example), or teams within an organization. As a LangSmith administrator, you may want to understand spend granularly per each of these units. In this case where you just want to cut spend, you can focus on the environment responsible for the majority of costs first for the greatest savings.\\n\\u200bInvoices\\nYou understand what usage looks like in terms of traces, but you now need to translate that into spend. To do so, navigate to the Invoices tab. The first invoice that will appear on screen is a draft of your current month’s invoice, which shows your running spend thus far this month.\\n\\nLangSmith’s Usage Graph and Invoice use the term tenant_id to refer to a workspace ID. They are interchangeable.\\nIn the GIF, you’ll see that the charges for LangSmith Traces are broken up by “tenant_id” (i.e., workspace ID), which means you can track tracing spend on each of the workspaces. In the first few days of June, the vast majority of the total spend of roughly $2,000 is in the production workspace. Further, the majority of spend in that workspace was on extended data retention trace upgrades.\\nThese upgrades occur for two reasons:\\n\\nYou use extended data retention tracing, which means by default your traces are retained for 400 days.\\nYou use base data retention tracing and use a feature that automatically extends the data retention of a trace. (Refer to the Auto-Upgrade conceptual docs.)\\n\\nGiven that the number of total traces per day is equal to the number of extended retention traces per day, it’s most likely the case that this organization is using extended data retention tracing everywhere. As a result, start by optimizing the retention settings.\\n\\u200bOptimization 1: manage data retention\\nLangSmith charges differently based on a trace’s data retention, where short-lived traces are an order of magnitude less expensive than ones that last for a long time. In this optimization, you’ll learn how to get optimal settings for data retention without sacrificing historical observability, and see the effect it has on the bill.\\n\\u200bChange org level retention defaults for new projects\\nNavigate to the Usage configuration tab, and look at the organization level retention settings. Modifying this setting affects all new projects that are created going forward in all workspaces in the organizaton.\\nFor backwards compatibility, older organizations may have this defaulted to Extended. Organizations created after June 3rd, 2024 have this defaulted to Base.\\n\\n\\u200bChange project level retention defaults\\nData retention settings are adjustable per project on the tracing project page.\\nNavigate to Projects > Your project name > Select Retention and modify the default retention of the project to Base. This will only affect retention (and pricing) for traces going forward.\\n\\n\\u200bApply extended data retention to a percentage of traces\\nYou may not want all traces to expire after 14 days. You can automatically extend the retention of traces that match some criteria by creating an automation rule. You might want to apply extended data retention to specific types of traces, such as:\\n\\n10% of all traces: For general analysis or analyzing trends long term.\\nErrored traces: To investigate and debug issues thoroughly.\\nTraces with specific metadata: For long-term examination of particular features or user flows.\\n\\nTo configure this:\\n\\nNavigate to Projects > Your project name > Select + New > Select New Automation.\\nName your rule and optionally apply filters or a sample rate. For more information on configuring filters, refer to filtering techniques.\\n\\nWhen an automation rule matches any run within a trace, then all runs within the trace are upgraded to be retained for 400 days.\\nFor example, this is the expected configuration to keep 10% of all traces for extended data retention:\\n\\nIf you want to keep a subset of traces for longer than 400 days for data collection purposes, you can create another run rule that sends some runs to a dataset of your choosing. A dataset allows you to store the trace inputs and outputs (e.g., as a key-value dataset), and will persist indefinitely, even after the trace gets deleted.\\n\\u200bSee results after 7 days\\nWhile the total amount of traces per day stayed the same, the extended data retention traces was cut heavily. In the invoice, the spend reduced to roughly $900 in the last 7 days, as opposed to $2,000 in the previous 4. That’s a cost reduction of nearly 75% per day.\\n\\n\\u200bOptimization 2: limit usage\\nIn the previous section, you managed data retention settings to optimize existing spend. In this section, you will use usage limits to prevent future overspend.\\nLangSmith has two usage limits: total traces and extended retention traces. These correspond to the two metrics tracked on the usage graph. You can use these in tandem to have granular control over spend.\\nTo set limits, navigate back to Settings -> Usage and Billing -> Usage configuration. There is a table at the bottom of the page that lets you set usage limits per workspace. For each workspace, the two limits appear, along with a cost estimate:\\n\\nStart by setting limits on production usage, since that is where the majority of spend comes from.\\n\\u200bSet a good total traces limit\\nPicking the right total traces limit depends on the expected load of traces that you will send to LangSmith. It is important to consider potential growth before setting a limit. For example:\\n\\nCurrent Load: The gen AI application is called between 1.2-1.5 times per second, and each API request has a trace associated with it, meaning it logs around 100,000-130,000 traces per day.\\nExpected Growth in Load: The expectation is that this will double in size in the near future.\\n\\nFrom these assumptions, you can calculate an approximate limit:\\nCopyAsk AIlimit = current_load_per_day * expected_growth * days/month\\n      = 130,000 * 2 * 30\\n      = 7,800,000 traces / month\\n\\nClick on the edit icon on the right side of the table for the Prod row to enter the limit.\\n\\nWhen set without the extended data retention traces limit, the maximum cost estimator assumes that all traces are using extended data retention.\\n\\u200bCut maximum spend with an extended data retention limit\\nFrom Optimization 1, you learned that the easiest way to cut cost was through managing data retention. The same is true for limits. If you only want to keep roughly 10% of traces to be around more than 14 days, you can set a limit on the maximum high retention traces you can keep. This would result in .10 * 7,800,000 = 780,000.\\n\\nThe maximum cost is cut from ~40k per month to ~7.5k per month, because you no longer allow as many expensive data retention upgrades. This ensures that new users on the platform will not accidentally cause cost to balloon.\\nThe extended data retention limit can cause features other than traces to stop working once reached. If you plan to use this feature, read more about its functionality and side effects.\\n\\u200bSet dev/staging limits and view total spent limit across workspaces\\nFollowing a similar logic for the dev and staging environments, you can set limits at 10% of the production limit on usage for each workspace.\\nWhile this works with this usage pattern, setting good dev and staging limits may vary depending on your use case with LangSmith. For example, if you run evals as part of CI/CD in dev or staging, you may want to be more flexible with your usage limits to avoid test failures.\\nWith the limits set, LangSmith shows a maximum spend estimate across all workspaces:\\n\\nYou can use the cost estimate to plan for your invoice total.\\n\\u200bSummary\\nIf you have questions about further optimizing your spend, please reach out to support@langchain.dev.Manage organizations using the APISet up resource tagsAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify')]"
